<h1>OptIn速</h1>
<h2>Making America Safer. Again. Again.</h2>
<h3>A terrible idea for the third annual<a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com"> Stupid Hackathon</a></h3>
<p>
Sam Kaufman and I built OptIn速 at the Stupid Hackathon (www.stupidhackathon.com) under the category, "Cybersecurity."
These days a lot of people worry about whether the NSA is watching what they are doing when they work on their computer. The act of worrying can be very stressful and we thought, "What if there was a way to remove that worry?..."
Well, now you don't have to wonder, you can know that the NSA (and everyone else for that matter) can see everything you've typed in glorious 140 charachter chunks.

We <strike>shamelessly stole</strike> referenced a lot of the basic keylogger functionality from https://gist.github.com/ljos/3019549

<h5>NOTE: WE CAN NOT RECCOMEND THAT YOU USE THIS!!! IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE STUPID IDEA>>> 
WE CLAIM ZERO LIABILITY FOR NOT LIMITED TO:
CRASHING YOUR COMPUTER, 
PISSING OFF THE NSA, 
GIVING YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS TO THE ENTIRE INTERNET TO USE FOR VARIOUS NEFARIOUS PURPOSES 
OR ANY OTHER WAYS YOU MANAGE TO RUIN YOUR LIFE OR ANYONE ELSE'S NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
USE AT ENTIRELY YOUR OWN DISCRETION and LIABILITY... THIS IS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE IDEA**
AGAIN, WE CLAIM ZERO LIABILITY FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS, IT IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</h5>
